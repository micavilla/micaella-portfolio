        <p>Previously graduated from UT Austin with a B.S. in Corporate Communications, I returned to my alma mater this year to complete an intensive coding bootcamp through their Center for Professional Education. Through the bootcamp, I gained extensive hands-on experience building full stack applications using, but not limited to, Node.js, Express, React, and MongoDB.

        My Communications background allows me to collaborate effectively and communicate technical concepts clearly. As a recent bootcamp graduate, I am eager to continue growing as a developer by learning new technologies and development techniques to expand my skillset. I am currently seeking roles where I can apply my existing technical and communications skills while continuing to learn from more experienced developers.
          
        My goal is to eventually become a well-rounded developer capable of tackling complex projects. I am a passionate and fast-learning coder dedicated to writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code. Please view my portfolio projects to see examples of what I have built so far. I am excited to bring my skills and passion to a development team as a junior developer!</p>
